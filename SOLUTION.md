# Design Approach

## Check Structure of Transactions

First of all we need to check the structure of the transaction which includes version, locktime, inputs and outputs.






# Implementation Details

Provide pseudo code of your implementation, including sequence of logic, algorithms and variables used etc.


# Result and Performance
Present the results of your solution, and analyze the efficiency of your solution.


# Conclusion
Discuss any insights gained from solving the problem, and outline potential areas for future improvement or research. Include a list of references or resources consulted during the problem-solving process.
